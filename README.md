#### What's Included:
- i3-gaps config (with the gaps)
- Polybar bars & configs
- URxvt AND Termite configs
- Optimized compton configs
- Oh-My-Zsh! configs
- Neovim configs
- Wallpaper

## Wallpaper
Wallpaper is from the movie, *"Kimi No Na Wa (Your Name),"* and was scaled up to **3920 x 2160** using [Waifu2x](http://waifu2x.udp.jp/)

## Why both URxvt AND Termite?
URxvt was being weird, and not displaying UTF-8 chars correctly for me, which prompted me to switch over to Termite for the time being. If you're having better luck with it, that's great, just know that I'll probably still be in termite-land.

Example install cmd (Using the yay package manager):
```
yay -Sy git i3 i3-gaps xorg polybar feh python-pywal rofi zsh oh-my-zsh-git rxvt-unicode termite neovim thunar compton xcwd-git betterlockscreen playerctl pulseaudio arc-gtk-theme arc-icon-theme ttf-font-awesome powerline-fonts-git noto-fonts ttf-ms-fonts jsoncpp light python-setuptools
```

## Setup
#### Set default shell to zsh
```
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

#### Set + Cache color palettes
In order to apply the color scheme for zsh and betterlockscreen, you need to set the wallpaper w/ pywal, which will also generate & cache the color palettes for zsh and betterlockscreen. (Note that if you wish to change the wallpaper and regenerate the color scheme, you will have to run this command again.)

```
wal -i ~/wallpaper.png
```

#### Update betterlockscreen
Betterlockscreen needs to be ran every time you update the wallpaper / monitor configuration, in order to generate accurate images for the lockscreen.
```
betterlockscreen ~/wallpaper.png
```

#### Install Oh-My-Zsh
Instead of directly installing oh-my-zsh from the Arch AUR, I installed it through their install scripts from the GitHub repo.

Curl:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Wget:
```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

#### Install + Setup vim plug
Install vim plug via the following command:
```
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Then, launch nvim using `nvim`, and run the command `:PlugInstall`

## Known Issues
#### No module named pkg_resources (While running wal)
[Stack Overflow Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7446187/no-module-named-pkg-resources)

Reinstall setuptools:
```
yay -Sy python-setuptools
```
